I am VERY displeased with your services. My internet goes out about 5 times when I am trying to just read my emails. I am quite dissatisfied with the poor quality of your service and wish to terminate business with your company. If I had known your service was so inferior  I NEVER would have applied for your service. Your representative misled me into believing I would be getting a quality product.

So u mean to tell me that my beam is CONGESTED already? download speed is 0.29 as of 9:15PM and I have the 50mbps plan and I have used about 156GB of data! How can my beam be congested already? I havent even had viasat2 for a month My speed has been 68-72mbps around the clock until now  If you gonna deprioritize me do it to 10mbps or something not less than 1mbps this is BS!

"I may be late to this party but between the first of April  2018 and June 24th reset of my data allowance  I was loosing 50GB of data in the two days following the reset.  I probably spent a total of over 35 hours on with Viasat trying to sort out the issues.  First  they said I couldn't be 'Losing data"" but I was.  I took my computer down to the basics of four devices to try to isolate the source.  Viasat could 'see' the four devices and they 'saw' something else  but couldn't identify it.  They just As I'm sure this blog will be the end of it and I will never hear from another Viasat robot again. everyone says  IF there were another solution  I would have been long gone..left me to hang out and dry until I threatened not to pay them.  Whether that was the cause  the data stopped flowing out and I have my normal usage back.  No call  no explanation  no message. NOTHING!!  I want to know what happened!!  Viasat owes me that as well as three months charges for data that was stripped from my account.  You train your phone staff well.  I had reached ""Corporate Resolution"" by this point.  You can't find out the name of the president of the company or any other person who gives a damn.  ",1,Account

"Misleading customers  why do it? I signed up for the 2year contract after being assured that xx would be my cost. I asked all the questions  regarding equipment lease  after care  service etc. Was assured that my cost would not change. The 1st issue was an additional charge at installation+ $35.00 for extra cable that the huge grizzly looking installer insisted that I pay in cash. Then the service drops off for no reason. At that point  most of the time  the device can't find the network. Of course it wouldn't do it when I call in about it. Today I get a notification that my price is going up $27.00 a month since a ""discount"" expired after 3 months. This ""discount was never disclosed to me. I called in and the attitude of the supervisor was basically...too bad.... take it or leave it. I'm certainly not a happy customer. They should have told me on the front end of the deal.

The installer came out today and upgraded my dish  he also had to move it a good 70-90 degrees from where it was originally pointing. He then installed my new modem which is beautiful. The modem comes with 802.11 AC MU MIMO which on default settings broadcast a 2.4 ghz SSID and a 5 ghz SSID. After installation and setup I have been receiving great speeds. The biggest question I had was how is latency. The latency seems exactly the same(590-650) as when I had the old dish and modem on Viasat-1. This was a great experience and a wonderful improvement. So far so good  I’m loving it.,0,Praise

ViaSat should not do this to their customers. You can't claim that the system is congested to the point that you have to drop all customers who exceeded the data limit  while you still try to acquire more customers. Instead you should advertise a more realistic speed  that can be maintained at all times  at least 1 Mbps download and upload. I don't care if I can get data at 10-20 Mbps for a short period of time while eating up quickly the 25 GB. Most of the data in there aren't actually required and just a function of the completely bloated system where you visit a website and see 50 additional processes sending and receiving all kinds of data to place ads and observe the user's actions. I bet that 90 percent of those 25 GB data were just for numerous handshakes between a host of observation aps that I haven't been able to control or disable.,1,Service
I just upgraded to the new Unlimited Gold plan which came with the new (triangular) ViaSat WiFi Gateway modem/router. I also have the VOIP phone service. Everything (internet and phone) works fine until I put the gateway into bridge mode. As soon as I do that (and it reboots)  the phone service cuts off. When I turn off bridge mode on the gateway and reboot  the phone service comes back. I've done this 3 or 4 times now with the same result. I want to use bridge mode so that I can use my own router (pfSense)  but obviously also need phone service. Has anyone else experienced this? I've emailed ViaSat support  but no response yet.

A little after 7am  the automated message changed to say that I had reached Viasat outside of customer service hours and that I would have to call back later.

I work from home  in zip 28114 (rural NC.)  I had Exede a few years back and it worked fine. I moved to a city  and have now moved back and am once again dealing with internet woes.Back when I used Exede before  video conferencing was not required for my job.  Now...it is. I've been testing out a Verizon Jetpack - we're in a 4G area  and while the internet works well  screensharing through Webex  which worked fine before both through Exede and through a Verizon hotspot previously  now has considerable lag. Video conferencing works only if I am receiving video  but not sending my own video  and even straight audio calls  (VOIP) are not reliable.Satellite is my only other option  although AT&T says that we're on the schedule to run fiber  which would include my house  they just can't/won't tell me when. I don't believe that will be anytime soon  however. So my questions are:While I am NOT a fan of the new pricing or being stuck in a 2 year contract  this may be my only option. I just want to make sure it IS an option before I go down this road. What are other people experiencing using video conferencing and screen sharing?,0,Service
I have encountered my first issue. And it happens every single time without fail.If signal is lost to a storm  the modem successfully reconnects on its own  but WiFi refuses to send or receive data.

"I signed up with Exede as part of a DirecTV package. Unfortunately DirecTV knows very little about what they're signing you up for. Exede caps your internet  meaning once you use up a certain amount of data  it slows down to dial-up speeds. You also have to use their own ""special"" satellite modem  and boy is it special. My internet dropped twice in the first half-an-hour of service. DirecTV also guaranteed I would have 30 days to cancel if I wasn't happy with the service. Well that was wrong too. Exede doesn't let you cancel  for any reason  without a cancellation fee of over $300. How can a service company not have some kind of trial period?

I could not upload anything to my web site today  i wanted to make a minor change but my FTP program kept getting rejected by the server as invalid. It was determined by the server that my problem was with the ISP Exede. I know they slow you down when you have used up the data allowance but I did not know they determined what you can upload and what you can't. This doesn't seem legal to me when they still allow downloads they control what a person uploads. I called Exede and they gave me another 5 Gb and I was able to upload again. When I upload it is very little data  and goes quickly. I wish I was made aware of this selective practice when I signed up  I probably would have made a different decision.,1,Account

VS2 was just installed today  I have been using it for about an hour now. Working great so far  downloading and general usage has been a lot better and a lot faster compared to VS1. I'm on the unlimited Gold 30 plan but I'm actually getting much better speeds than advertised.Which is about 4.5 - 5 MB/s for download.Question about the old equipment though. I know I have to send the old modem and a part from the old satellite back. Does anyone know about how long it takes usually for the boxes to ship / arrive and will Viasat send them automatically now that my new service is set up? I would like to have a rough idea so I can be sure to contract someone if I don't see them  don't want to be charged for something that I have no issue with sending back.Assuming speed doesn't take a nose dive later on  good job to Viasat. Lol.,1,Technical
So yesterday  I decided to give my computer a rest and concentrate on other things  like chores on the property.I set up the download scheduler to download some items during the LNFZ  giving plenty of buffer time between the start and stop times.One way for Viasat to increase revenue without raising monthly fees is to tamper with the data usage calculation.If true  this would be more smoke and mirror tactics  just like implying an expected  download speed of 12 mbps when its actual occurrence is miniscule or stating (not implying)  that we should expect download speeds in excess of 1 mbps after reaching our monthly allowance.I have traveled all over the world. I found these smoke and mirror tactics in third world bazaars. I did not expect to find them in the US from large corporations.﻿,0,DNR

My VS2 high density beam install is done! I was given VIP status which I’m told is typically reserved for employees. Basically there were two inspections. One from a supervisor who came in person and another over a video conference on the installers cell phone with I presume to be a Viasat representative. The good. I’m not experiencing any of the issues that Andy has. YouTube plays instantly with no buffering and downloading music is no problem either. FAST.COM reports 1.9 mb/s. The bad is the highest speed I’ve achieved over WiFi is 30 mb/s. Have not had time to check with a wired connection. My only other concern was the SNR is only 6.5. Have much higher on my VS1 connection. So far I’m only in 30 minutes  but things seem good. Instagram  Facebook  Tumblr  etc all load way faster then VS1 setup.

First things first. Internet works  it works just fine.

We've been having some seriously bad weather the past 2 days and today when the sat went out ( VS2 Large Beam ) I put in the 192.168.100.1 to check out the signal. Interestingly enough  the signal on VS2 can actually go below zero. I didn't lose connection until it dropped below -4 . It bottomed out at -11. I watched it fluctuate in the low negatives and as soon as it got to -3.8 it synced and went into ranging and then went back online. The reason I mention this is that if you change from VS1 to VS2 then the signal readings are as different as night is to day. On VS1  zero is just that......zero. This could possible be why the signal seems to be so low with VS2. The scale is different. ,0,DNR

So today I found out I didn't update exede with new CC mailed to me. I get it it......my fault. I thought I did and only email I have received since my billing day on the 20th is thank you for your payment on my billing day. That said.......I ran diagnostics on phone app....no issues listed. So I called into viasat after 3-4 restarts and was told my estimated wait time is 2 min......great! That was 1 hour and 30 minutes ago. While on hold I decided to teather phone and see if I could find out anything on my.viasat. Low and behold it told me my account was suspended for non payment. Figured ok I'll add my new card and pay the bill. Which I did. Now I have an authorization on my card for my monthly bill and still no internet and to top it off I'm still on hold. I'm tempted to try processing payment on the phone but afraid I'll get double billed and overdraw my account so I'm still waiting on hold hopeing there is someone working there tonight. This is by far the longest hold time I have ever had calling into viasat and it all could of been avoided had you just sent me a simple email stating there was a problem with your payment method on file. So gonna stay on hold for who knows how much longer trying to get an agent on the phone to figure out status of the payment I just submitted.,1,Account
So I got an email saying my password for my exede account (where I check data  pay bill  etc.) was changed but I never changed it. I thought the email was related to recent changes that I made to my plan (just upgraded to unlimited gold 30  installer is coming next week). So I immediately tried to log into my account  but I was getting an error from salesforce (which I assume exede uses to handles payments and stuff). I forgot to write it down but it finally let me in  using the old password. So it appears my password was never actually changed?Has anyone else got a message like this in the last 24 hours as I'm wondering if this may be a false alarm or issue on salesforce's end?To be on the safe side  I immediately changed my password. Should I still call exede like it says in the email  would there be any point to doing so since I was able to log in and change the password? If someone did access to my account it appears they would be able to get my name  address  and last 4 digits of my CC but not much else. Would Exede be able to tell me if someone with an usual IP or something did access my account?,1,Account

Satellite internet first became available to me during December 2001. It was download only. I still needed a dial up connection to upload commands. I thought it was just great.In checking my records  I paid $180 for the equipment and $40 a month for the service. I also had to pay the dial up ISP for the system to be usable.I do not remember the download speed but it probably was slower than today’s Viasat throttled rate. Moreover  it was controlled by how fast I could send instructions by dial up.So here we are seventeen years later. I pay $50 per month for 12 gb and usually get 1 mb/s during the weekday when the children are in school. This is unless I am throttled when I exceed 12 gb  in which case my download speeds are typically less than 0.4 mb/s. In addition  there are  times when my download speed is 0.2 mb/s during periods of congestion  even though I have not reached my threshold of 12 gb. And the congestion periods are getting longer every month.Now  if Viasat had told me the truth about speeds  I probably would be satisfied with this performance. It is the exaggerations about performance that makes many people irate.,0,DNR

Tech youre talking to on the phone is making detailed notes on your account. He's in the middle of telling you how you will be compensated as well just then a survey cuts him off like totally. Forced to call back to get customer service  asked to be put back though to tech support just to be talked to like a <removed> that we dont know what we are saying and so forth. Never mind about the detailed notes on our account. Got a $10 credit for satellite service that dont want to work. Centurylink is faster! Needless to say  a Viastat agents ears are burning and probably having a bad night now. Reporting them is an understatement.,0,DNR

"I started with EXede about three months ago, and I have yet to ever reach the 12 mpbs that they claim i should get. I have called about this of course and they tell me i am using too much data. In my case, I reach my data cap in about five days. i recently fell asleep at 2 am watching a movie, and that caused me to"" excede"" my data for the month. The Viasat rep said Never do that - you wouldnt leave your water running all night would you? Your data is the same way.'' Of course, she claims the cure for this problem is to give them more money for this incredibly ###### service. I decided to try Exede because other local carriers had gotten too expensive. Unfortunatley Viasat/Exede is not worth any of the money i am paying for it. There has to be a way to stop this incredbile consumer rip-ff.""",0,Service

hi there im a exede vaisat customer ive read the comments and rather good or bad they all are true.when the service is congested it dose cause slow speeds but its only temporarily it gose back up to 1mbps once it lighten up if you are out of datta or if now you have unlimeted its full speeds after traffic is decreased by less people useing the service.but even if you have pirorty datta it still will be slow if its congested but not less than 1mbps i had this service for 9 years im a vaule dedicated customer so they gave me a 10 dollar discount for a year for being a loyal customer.to get good service you have to be patient.understand no mater who you get service with if they are overloaded it will lag thats how the internet works. it wont never change because of the growing demands.,0,Praise
"I spend almost 77 dollars a month for the crappiest internet service I have EVER had in my life!  I have been without internet for a month now (but STILL paying for it.).  My modem is disconnected and wifi hasn't worked in a month. Yet somehow I have managed to go OVER my allotted data allowance!

My download speeds are a consistent 36 KB - 16 KB.  KILOBYTES.  AGAIN, IT'S 2018 AND I'M DOWNLOADING SLOWER THAN AOL DIAL UP DAYS.

I cannot watch a movie, load a web page or god forbid, check my email.

Customer service is a JOKE, and the reason my service isn't working is because my router is faulty.  I tried explaining that a TORNADO moved my satellite (my neighborhood is listed as a Disaster Area by FEMA, so I would think that customer service would come and move my satellite back into it's normal position).

I'm locked in this crap contract for another year.

I was told this plan would be good for it and you could watch like 75 hours of Netflix a month. I agreed and got the internet installed the end of April. Within 5 hours of being installed I received an email saying that we had used 100% of our usage. 
I called them the next day and was told to try it for one month. It reset on May 1st and on May 9th 100% has been used. It is not going to work and I have been fighting with them all month to get early termination fees waived since I was given incorrect information to get me to buy this service. They won’t let me tak to someone in the corporate office and thats not right. What can I do to get this solved?",1,Service

"I don't mean this to be a negative, so don't take it that way, but sometimes I think companies can be their own worst enemy in setting unrealistic expectations for customers.

On Viasat's twitter feed they have a little animation clip saying they offer ""broadband for all"".  Okay, I get they want to do that and planned to do that.  But as we know, broadband is defined as 25Mbps.  There are many areas of the country right now where the highest level of speed being sold is at 12Mbps.  So if I am a potential customer and see the twitter post I am thinking one thing, but then come to find out I can't get broadband speed in the available plans (I am not even getting into the 'up to' debate here).

Again, I am just making an observation.  We want Viasat to succeed, but I think it is better to under promise and over deliver.  Maybe that is what they are doing with the 12Mbps plans now, just don't call it ""broadband internet"" yet nationwide. ",0,Service

We recently signed up with Exede/Viasat and are very unhappy with the speeds. Customer service is dismal. I've been told by a tech savvy friend that we can get much better speeds if we use our own router. Viasat will not let us out of paying their monthly fee for their poor performing modem. It is so wrong to force us to use their sub par equipment. I am so sorry I signed up with this company. Any suggestions are welcome.,1,Inquiry
