"modem question my friend next door has 2 out of 4 lights going on his modem , is that some kind of blocking or low on the usage? The care takerdude is cutting down more and more avocado trees and thinks it might be     the tree who are blocking the reception and I think they low on the usage. Do you know and could tell me. Mahalo from the eastside of Maui and Aloha to all of you.","0","Technical"
"Horrible Service! I don't recommend this interenet provider!  I was misled into thinking i'd get good service at a cheaper rate.  I was paying $70.00 a month for AT&T Uverse.  DirecTV in conjuntion with Exede told me i'd get it for $29.99.  My monthly bill from Exede is about $62.00  I also have no speed after about 10 days.  If i want more I have to buy! LOL  Uverse I never had to worry.  Beware!","0","Service"
"Why am I getting billed for this moth if my service is suspended? Hell I'm through with Exede, I'm up to 60 - 70 Gigs for this month and loving it. Fix my bill and tell me where to send this crap back to. I've been off contract for years. Getting speeds generally 5x - 10x faster than Exede and unlimited data so I'm done. I might have to pay a small VPN fee every month but I'm done stop billing me for nothing, Hell the modem has been completely disconnected this month, don't need it any more.","1","Account"
"What I'm tried of is paying this high price for internet and always worried about data all time when you want to watch Netflix or vudu. This is bs when I had cable internet didn't have to worry about data. If they want happy customer they need to fix this problem. Cell phone company have better data rates than excede. Maybe I will look into to dishnet because I have dishnetwork. You suck","0","DNR"
"Will never recommend Exede to anyone I know or even don't know. Satellite usage was terrible. We went through our amount of usage in a couple days without performing much of anything. Then, the internet ran very, very slow. Will never go away from wired internet in the future. Also, customer service was not flexible and forced me to get on my roof in the winter to send a part from the dish or be charged another $200. Also, tried to email customer service for 3 months and never heard back. Was able to reach someone over the phone but again as noted not very friendly and appeared to only be after my money for cancellation fees. Go with any other carrier instead of Exede!","0","Service"
"There is no additional charge for going over our 10GB limit correct? I was told that once over your limit that the speeds are greatly reduced but no additional charge - Someone please verify this for me.","1","Inquiry"
"I was on the phone for nearly two hours with Exede today when my call was directed to tech support.  The tech support agent was horrible and she treated me like an idiot.  Not only was she rude and condescending, she also kept interrupting and talking over me.  When I had enough of her madness, I asked to speak to her supervisor and she said one wasn't available.  She put me on terminal hold and then she hung up on me.  So, now I feel horrible and my problem unresolved.  Exede needs to get it together before we (customers) unite and seek legal recourse.","1","Service"
"I am happy so far with my internet service, but am highly disappointed in customer service. After being told twice that the promotion would be honored, I should not have to call the next three months and deal with rude people to make sure I get it.","1","Service"
